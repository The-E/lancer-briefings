# Phase // #004
## True Polymorph
# Sitrep: King of the Hill / Control
# Goals
- Seize and hold control of the Stations Printing facilities while the Militia is making a push for the control center.
- The push for the command center should draw most of the enemies forces

# Stakes
- If the Facilities are not seized, control of the station will not be able to be held, because OpFor has access to numerous reinforcements.
- Destruction of the Facilities should only be a last resort.
- Control of the facilities will allow for the creation of flash-printed turret units.
# Complications
- Area will be dense with volatile equipment, collateral damage should be minimized, if possible.
