# Phase // #003
## Time Stop
# Sitrep: Holdout / Control
# Goals
- Keep Control of the Defense Platform until militia forces can arrive.

# Stakes
- Loosing control of the Platform even momentarily will incur damage on the incoming militia forces
- The Defense platform is heavily fortified and guarded by a pair of automated artillery cannons. These cannons can be disabled or even commandeered if their control zones are captured

# Complications
- Any Supplies that fell to the OpFor during Phase 1 will be utilized by them here.
- Expect heavy resistance
