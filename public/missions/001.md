# Phase // #001
## "Meteor Swarm"
# Sitrep: Insertion / Escort
# Goals
- Insert to exterior of the Gate-Station close to Defense Platform 17-A
- Optional: Defend supply-sled and escort it to ground

# Stakes
- Time is critical. Initial resistance likely null, but overwhelming defense will quickly be dispatched
- Supplies will include a targeting jammer, that will mostly disable automated ground based defenses. 

# Complications
- Simultaneously launched chaff will provide cover, but expect interception fire
- OpFor will be interested in claiming the supplies, but will not stop from destroying them if unable to claim them
- Supplies left behind will be claimed by OpFor
- Drop will be very hot, there will be no time for a Rest before Phase 2

# Reserves
- Each Mech will be equipped with external EVA packs
