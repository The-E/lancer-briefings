# Phase // #002
## Storm of Vengeance
# Sitrep: Gauntlet / Control
# Goals
- Seize Control of Defense Platform 17-A to open a corridor for the militia forces

# Stakes
- Failing to shut down the Anti-Ship Spinal Guns will make approach of the militia nigh impossible, or at least prohibitively costly.
- The Defense platform is heavily fortified and guarded by a pair of automated artillery cannons. These cannons can be disabled or even commandeered if their control zones are captured

# Complications
- Any cover or automated defenses destroyed in the assault will not be available in Phase 3
- Expect heavy resistance
